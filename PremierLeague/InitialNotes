From whoscored.com utilize matchCentreData in the command window to pull JSON data
From there, all match data can be found

KeyNotes:
	In the events section, x and y are the location the event occured
	If a distribution event (pass,shot,goal,etc.) occurs, the EndX,EndY is where the ball ended up
		The following event does not always start at the location of the previous EndX,EndY
			Can use the difference in this to show ball movement of a player (ie: dribbling)
	The when using video to reference X,Y data, don't forget that the camera angle depends on if they are going up/down left/right from origin.
